# lua-rhythm-game
A little challenge I set myself, to build a functioning rhythm game over the weekend. The game is playable but is missing held notes, which is something I plan on implementing at a later date.

To use this project you will need to have Roblox Studio installed - this can be found at https://www.roblox.com/create 
However, I have left the script files in this Git repo so they be looked at.
