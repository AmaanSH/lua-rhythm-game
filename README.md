A little challenge I set myself, to build a functioning rhythm game over the weekend. The game is playable but is missing held notes, which is something I plan on implementing at a later date.

To use this project you will need to have Roblox Studio installed - this can be found at https://www.roblox.com/create. You will need to launch place.rbxl using this. 

Alternatively the project can be found here - https://www.roblox.com/games/3438315310/Rhythm-Game-Showcase

However, I have left the script files in this Git repo so they be looked at. This was one of my first main projects using lua.
